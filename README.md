Corey passed away suddenly on April 15h, 2023 as a result of some medical issues that were found too late to treat.

I miss my friend. We've been best friends since before birth, when our moms went to a ZZTop concert together.
We've got lots of memories together, that now only exist in my head, along with the other of our small group of friends.

I wondered, since we mainly talked over discord, could I take our conversations that we've had over the past N years, and in turn, make a chatbot that would replicate the mannerisms of my now-deceased friend?
