A project to digitally resurrect loved ones in the form of a memorial chatbot interface

a Self-hosted web app featuring a large language model which can ~~easily~~ be trained on conversation data exported from popular chat apps

## rambling history
This is my friend Corey

Corey passed away suddenly on April 15th, 2023 as a result of some medical issues that were found too late to treat.

I miss my friend. We've been best friends since before birth, when our moms went to a ZZTop concert together.
I've got a lot of memories with him that I'd love to crystalize in a way that's accessible even years from now. I could write things about him in a book, or a blog, but to be able to talk with a loved one who's passed is, I imagine, a fairly universal desire.
His passing happened in the same few week span as GPT-4 coming out. We were all having a blast with stable diffusion, and imaging the possibilities of a radically enhanced AI future...

After the pangs of grief gave way to good days and bad, I started to wonder... Since Corey and I mainly talked over discord, could I take our conversations that we've had over the past 5 years on the platform and train an LLM like ChatGPT to make a chatbot that would attempt to impersonate the my now-deceased friend?

Before I get accused of necromancy, I want to be clear. This project is intended to memorialize a loved one, and to possibly offer a tool to grieving friends and family.

I'm not a programmer, but I feel like I know enough to break this down into steps.

## roadmap
- [x] download all available data to use for training

  - I used [DiscordMate - Discord Chat Exporter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/discord/ofjlibelpafmdhigfgggickpejfomamk) to grab our chat history on Discord. It goes much further back on google hangouts, but I've got a google takeout thing happening now
